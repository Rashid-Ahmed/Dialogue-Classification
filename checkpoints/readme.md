Due to policy reasons, i cannot share the model checkpoints. You can however train your own checkpoints. Go to config.ini and use your own hyperparameters, instead of the dummy ones. You can then run training.py to generate checkpoints. 

Note: If you train you will need to put device on cuda to use gpu for training.
